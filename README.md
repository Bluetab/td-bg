# Truedat Business Glossary

TdBG is a back-end service developed as part of the Truedat project that supports the generation of a Business Glossary

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`

To start your Phoenix server:

### Installing

- Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

- Now you can visit [`localhost:4002`](http://localhost:4002) from your browser.

## Running the tests

Run all aplication tests with `mix test`

## Environment variables

- `REDIS_AUDIT_STREAM_MAXLEN` (Optional) Maximum length for Redis audit stream. Default: 100
- `REDIS_STREAM_MAXLEN` (Optional) Maximum length for Redis stream. Default: 100

### SSL Connection

- `DB_SSL`: Boolean value to enable SSL configuration. Default is `false`.
- `DB_SSL_CACERTFILE`: Path to the Certification Authority (CA) certificate file, e.g. `/path/to/ca.crt`.
- `DB_SSL_VERSION`: Supported versions are `tlsv1.2` and `tlsv1.3`. Default is `tlsv1.2`.
- `DB_SSL_CLIENT_CERT`: Path to the client SSL certificate file.
- `DB_SSL_CLIENT_KEY`: Path to the client SSL private key file.
- `DB_SSL_VERIFY`: Specifies whether server certificates should be verified (`true`/`false`).

### Elastic bulk page size configuration

- BULK_PAGE_SIZE_CONCEPTS: default 500

### Elastic aggregations

- The aggregation variables are defined as follows: AGG\_<AGGREGATION_NAME>\_SIZE

### ElasticSearch authentication

#### (Optional) Basic HTTP authentication

These environment variables will add the Authentication header on each request
with value `Basic <ES_USERNAME>:<ES_PASSWORD>`

- ES_USERNAME: Username
- ES_PASSWORD: Password

#### (Optional) ApiKey authentication

This environment variables will add the Authentication header on each request
with value `ApiKey <ES_API_KEY>`

- ES_API_KEY: ApiKey

#### (Optional) HTTP SSL Configuration (Normally required for ApiKey authentication)

These environment variables will configure CA Certificates for HTTPS requests

- ES_SSL: [true | false] required to activate following options
- ES_SSL_CACERTFILE: (Optional) Indicate the cacert file path. If not set, a certfile will be automatically generated by `:certifi.cacertfile()`
- ES_SSL_VERIFY: (Optional) [verify_peer | verify_none] defaults to `verify_none`

### ElasticSearch Force Merge Configuration

These environment variables control the force merge operation for ElasticSearch indices, which optimizes index performance by merging segments.

- `ES_WAIT_FOR_COMPLETION`:
  - **Purpose**: Controls whether the force merge operation should wait for completion before returning
  - **Default**: `nil` (no wait)
  - **Usage**: When set to `true`, the operation will wait until the force merge is complete before returning. When `false` or `nil`, the operation returns immediately and runs asynchronously
  - **Performance**: Setting to `true` ensures the operation is complete but may cause longer response times

- `ES_MAX_NUM_SEGMENTS`:
  - **Purpose**: Specifies the maximum number of segments to merge down to
  - **Default**: `5`
  - **Usage**: Controls how aggressively the force merge operation consolidates segments. Lower values result in fewer, larger segments
  - **Performance**: Fewer segments generally improve search performance but may increase memory usage during the merge operation

### Oban configuration

- OBAN_DB_SCHEMA:
  Purpose: Defines the database schema where Oban will create its tables
  Default value: "private"
  Usage: Configures the schema prefix for Oban tables (jobs, peers, etc.)
  Example: If set to "oban_schema", tables will be created in the schema oban_schema.jobs, oban_schema.peers, etc.

- OBAN_CREATE_SCHEMA:
  Purpose: Controls whether Oban should automatically create the database schema
  Default value: "true"
  Usage: Determines if the Oban migration should create the schema specified in OBAN_DB_SCHEMA
  Valid values:
  "true": Automatically creates the schema
  "false": Does not create the schema (must exist beforehand)

#### Oban Cron Jobs Configuration

- `OUTDATED_EMBEDDINGS_CRON`:
  Purpose: Defines the cron schedule for the OutdatedEmbeddings worker
  Default value: "0 */3 * * *" (every 3 hours)
  Usage: Controls when the system processes outdated embeddings for data structure versions
  Example: "0 2 * * *" for daily execution at 2 AM

- `EMBEDDINGS_DELETION_CRON`:
  Purpose: Defines the cron schedule for the EmbeddingsDeletion worker
  Default value: "@hourly"
  Usage: Controls when the system performs cleanup of deleted embeddings
  Example: "0 */6 * * *" for execution every 6 hours

#### Oban Queue Configuration

- `OBAN_QUEUE_DEFAULT`:
  Purpose: Sets the number of concurrent workers for the default queue
  Default value: "5"
  Usage: Controls the parallelism for general background jobs

- `OBAN_QUEUE_EMBEDDING_UPSERTS`:
  Purpose: Sets the number of concurrent workers for embedding upsert operations
  Default value: "10"
  Usage: Controls the parallelism for creating and updating embeddings

- `OBAN_QUEUE_EMBEDDING_DELETION`:
  Purpose: Sets the number of concurrent workers for embedding deletion operations
  Default value: "5"
  Usage: Controls the parallelism for embedding cleanup jobs

### Embedding Management

- `LIMIT_OUTDATED_EMBEDDINGS`: 
  - **Purpose**: Controls the maximum number of data structure versions that can be processed in a single batch when updating outdated embeddings
  - **Default**: `50000`
  - **Usage**: Used by the OutdatedEmbeddings worker (runs every 3 hours via cron) to limit the number of data structure versions processed when finding and updating missing or outdated record embeddings
  - **Performance**: Prevents memory issues and ensures system stability when processing large numbers of outdated embeddings
